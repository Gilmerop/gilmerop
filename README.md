### Hi there 👋 I'm Gilmer

I'm a Systems Engineer based in Medellín, Colombia.

I love working with technology, leading IT support teams, and automating repetitive tasks to make life easier.

🔧 **What I do:**
- 🛠️ IT Support & Infrastructure
- 🧠 Documenting and sharing technical knowledge
- 💡 Tools I use regularly: ⚡ PowerShell • ☁️ Azure • 🖥️ Windows Server (AD, DNS, GPO, RDP) • 🧰 Git • 🐧 Bash

🚀 **Currently learning and exploring:**
- Self-hosting with Proxmox and VPN solutions
- Linux deeply (Ubuntu-based distros)
- Scripting and workflow automation
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Docker (just getting started!)

🧪 **My repositories are my lab**  
This is where I document, build and test real-world solutions — both for work and personal growth.

### Hi there 👋 I'm Gilmer

I'm a Systems Engineer based in Medellín, Colombia 
I love working with technology, leading IT support teams, and automating repetitive tasks to make life easier.

🔧 **What I do:**
- 🛠️ IT Support & Infrastructure
- 🧠 Documenting and sharing technical knowledge

🚀 **Currently learning and exploring:**
- Self-hosting with Proxmox and VPN solutions
- Linux deeply (Ubuntu-based distros)
